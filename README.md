## ALPACA Model
ALPACA (ALkaliphilic Protein ClAssifiCAtion) is an innovative in-silico method designed for the classification of alkaliphilic proteins using deep learning techniques. Inspired by recent advancements in language models (LMs) and protein language models (pLMs), ALPACA employs embeddings derived from the ESM-2(3B) pLM using a Feed-forward Neural Network (FNN) architecture. The approach bypasses manual feature extraction by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, treating protein sequences as if they were sentences and extracting vector representations (embeddings) directly. The comparison involved four different pretrained language models - ProtT5-XL-U50, ESM-1b, ESM-2 with 650M parameters, and ESM-2 with 3B parameters. These embeddings were used as input features for machine learning models, starting with a logistic regression model and subsequently extending to more complex models like ALPACA, a two-layer FNN.
